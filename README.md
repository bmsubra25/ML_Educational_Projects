# ML_Educational  

Beginner-friendly implementations of classic deep learning models with explanations.  

This repository contains machine learning models that each come with a mini-article explaining how it works under the hood.  

## Statement of Purpose  

This repository documents my learning journey in Machine Learning through example models and explanations. The goal is to provide code and articles that explain how each architecture works, and to encourage learning through reading, experimentation, and results.  

### Current Status (V1)  

Currently implemented: Multi-Layer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, Transformer.  
Planned: Diffusion Model, LIF Neuron, Graph Convolutional Network.  

If you are new to ML, start with the code and markdown file in the Multi-Layer Perceptron directory.
